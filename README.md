# TechTalentSouth-Java
This is a repo containing all my Java assignments/exercises I completed during the Full Stack Web Development program hosted by Tech Talent South.

intro:
- practiced creating fields & local variables while getting familiar with compiler errors from incorrect syntax

Person:
- practiced OOP by writing a program that initialized a constructor, local variables, getters, and setters to print out a final statement
